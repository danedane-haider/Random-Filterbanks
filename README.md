This repository contains tools to study statistics and stability properties of filterbanks with random FIR filters of fixed support. Moreover, we provide notebooks to reproduce all experiments of the accompanying papers "Instabilities of Convnets for Raw Audio" and "Stability of random filterbanks under gradient descent: Theory and practice".
