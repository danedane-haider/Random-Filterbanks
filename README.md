# Random Filterbanks

This repository contains tools to study energy preservation and stability properties of filterbanks with random FIR filters. Moreover, we provide notebooks to reproduce all experiments of the accompanying papers "Energy preservation and stability of random filterbanks" and "Stability of random filterbanks under gradient descent: Theory and practice".
